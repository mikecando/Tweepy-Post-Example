The Lord said to his disciples, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and in him God is glorified
if God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. 
little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me 
as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, 'Where I am going you cannot come.' 
A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 
By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.
Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now
"Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times."
Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me. 
In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? 
I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way where I am going." 
"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me. 
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves. 
he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. 
Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; 
if you ask anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, you will keep my commandments. 
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth
